##### Resource management in the context of wireless IoT may include several aspects[1](Game Theoretic Mechanisms for Resource Management in Massive Wireless IoT Systems)
• Spectrum allocation
• Power control
• Interference management
• Backhaul resource allocation
• Allocation of storage and computing resources in the cloud
