peeker office is really too big need to have two staff in the front oh thank you please the website has some problem so we fasting today there have some problem is different from al-qaeda - if we want to used like this we need faster and the the problem is is this is very Cosco and the test I used I mean our our is successful data transfer rate and this P is we need a paid power energy so back to the beginning most energy efficiency well-meaning quality of service hmm but if the goal is to minimize the total bang energy then why is it total power I mean okay this okay constrain you've written here is sum over R P IJ less than or equal to P max but then you say P max knows the maximum transmit power between user re-infestation J if that's the case then why are you suing over I I is the users number I mean I said the there is the already I have the number the number of the user keep max I mean you you see the max may be may be worthy so we we see the Miffy Max's so this delay delay Wallace P max P max - I mean that all the people all the night the power math example all the other people holdin that Network whole network I think maybe starting in what's very much a PRG is the ivory i reveai store customer everywhere yes IJ is the base that is the power of a base station yeah what's I is the you use I mean there is a user number if it's the power of a station once the user number have to do with it when the onion can control our api's under under Bobby is the user number so if this yes is a lot of people we have - then answer my question like what is prj a genius okay but it's not I mean the notation tells you that the notation has a subscript I and a subscript J yeah I know you know that some people are saying here about what you've written what is P I J what does it mean I mean I mean I think I know what it's supposed to mean cuz it's not what you've written there yes I know maybe maybe just touch it once Pik maybe that works but that's another matter so I just don't know I mean you use climb here that I is the user number in J is the base station number yeah so my guess is the pIJ is supposed to be the transmit power I mean what what you've written here is a transmit power between user I and base station J I'm not sure whether that means uplink or downlink but if we're talking about power allocation for base stations which is most likely then really we should do something to really there's something backwards here because what I think is intended as I think that this summation is supposed to sum the total power of a base station over and so I think prj is supposed to be the total power that base station J has allocated transmit power allocated to user I and then if you sum this then you get the total power out the total power of the base station this is transmitting out and you and the constraint says that that needs to be less than or equal to P max for every base stations yeah yeah yeah I mean okay carry on yeah continues okay so this this delayed install from the we already talked this feature under this tipper but it differently is is they they're not defined by is controls the controls data they sleep okay but here we reach in the mine is the function of the package part I think the packet maybe we use the package that lays nice this so if if the size is smaller may be fast but very long will be work that way I mean this equation made sense of that paper because it's what are the units baby teeth baby baby oh baby t is a week with a river right package it mean is that I thought for example that ethical for package and cat I have done the package so the lady I try to the file and I have done to so Q is sweet but I mean the us also the Q with three but I want an older IRA package the love site if the site is more maybe fast maybe not often the number we just connect to the website to this people use the all the packing occasion to packet queue yeah so what we want to know the IRA package the size it because I mean the paper Dell essentially didn't worry about packet size the paper dealt with this and so this was like the change in the number of bits that were in the queue was equal to the number of bits that arrived - the number of bits that were departed and the number of bits that were departed was given by the current bit rate times the time increment okay I remember the favor inside should be yes FBI key yes oh well Hugh was in bits but this was in yeah so the unit's here are bits because RB is that's per second and DTE is seconds and abt is also bits I mean the problem it's not clear that the bit rate if you want to start getting into packet size you have to totally redo this math with packets not with bits and so you can't just make the bit rate of a function of the packet size that doesn't work the bit rate is not really a function of the packet size yeah okay okay the the district part is but the life and strength doesn't really work right yeah yeah well be able to see you a little bit before three yes okay how long do you need maybe ten minutes okay why don't you come in to 45 or so I think I have something Oh hey Charles right the best part is work with us tonight [Music] okay [Music] the street is we had sad I said IR is something the three parties we use the rav ice under user the user had another Derby ice I mean this is an inequality constraint it's not an equality constraint and I mean really neither is the delay constraint that when that doesn't that's an expression of the delay it's not a as you currently written that it's not a constraint and this one should this last one the constraint on the number of associated users should be an inequality constraint not what you've written right now which is equality look at first I'm using usme mean maybe care okay maybe yeah k is a equilateral constraints work composition problems because you're trying to decide about Association and so you say you know the number of associated users needs to be less than or equal to some maximum number of associated users which is K well I mean the yes power is the key number controller okay maybe is very important the case number will be the tourist transfer that they have the cave is number P number is small little small they don't follow I mean K is as you say constraint on the number of associated users yeah and that's some expression on the left sum over I of X IJ if X IJ is okay there's no way the statement underneath there is not correct that doesn't make any sense so our X IJ is the number of users under every day station any where's the problem one sec Sanjay thank you where is the ice next idea is axis the number of the user X is the user number probably some user numbers yes was wrong no I'm not a CCC yeah after the first things first idea is the the X idea is here B is the high number under the I mean the X idea is what values can X IJ take on we have cancer hold on just one sec Jeremy jae-min I mean the next time jay is a binary random variable that says whether x RI is associated with base station J and the values that can take on such that some X IJ is the number of users who are associated with base station J and so then the appropriate constraint is that the sum over I of X IJ is less than or equal to KJ but maybe right up everybody yeah but equals one should be less than or equals yeah yeah but but I mean the statement underneath that well I mean it does it's not I don't even know what it's supposed to say but it's not correct where X IJ is the number of users from there everyone based vision that doesn't even make sense but some some [Music] I'll be honest with you I'm very concerned because you're showing the equations that I'm asking you what I think are very basic questions about them and you're my labels answer sorry I some sometimes I listen to clarity and some time I earned some time to to study the state prostate but I would not even talk about all I mean what's okay I guess other than the Hubble you know I mean there are elements so what we talked about last time was the need to know what problem we were talking about initially and there are elements here that maybe belong in a problem I mean you talked a little bit up top here about minimizing the total energy which is potentially an appropriate thing to maximize it still would make sense here to write down a expression for the total energy before you get into constraints but but anyway and then some of these constraints are things that I think will be appropriate and such an optimization problem but I don't feel like there's a complete if not there's not a complete problem formulation here there are elements of a problem formulation and the elements at this moment don't necessarily look to me like they go together maybe they do but it's not clear to me that they do but I mean that's all okay I mean one other thing there it's on the SNR constraint got the probability didn't usually that's si and are not that same IR but you've got probability at that side and R is greater than or equal to canvas and I made which is okay except si NR probably needs some subscripts on it too because I need to know what I really need to know what link we're talking about the SI n R being greater than threshold and it actually relates to this xrj which has to do to with what base station the what base station user is allocated to so there are elements here but it's not the whole story what's this last things supposed to be I understand you've written down an expression for energy efficiency however paper used but I mean that's energy efficiency in terms of eight bits per second per Joule bits per second per watt [Music] but one of the where does the energy efficiency fit into the optimization problem I mean your claim at the top here is that you're trying to minimize the total energy while you satisfy quality of service constraints now I don't really see the quality of service constraints written down yeah except maybe the SNR constraint but but that's going to be trying to minimize the total that's going to be trying to minimize the total number of joules to deliver the best and when you put your quality service constraints in there it's going to be subject to well you've got a constraint on that side an R which gives rise to constraint on rate okay so you're trying to minimize power what are we going to do with this expression of energy efficiency I mean the other guy to the other researcher to the seniors transport small - small high transport three house right from high file transfer read transfer rate yeah okay there are people want to do to this since I mean we can do like I did know the successful theory maybe just next like we want to transform they talk about that sometimes I just want to do this so I care successful Italy not well trusted you because the degree maybe is some may be fast but sometimes maybe the package is two or three feet long oh no no no Paul maybe 10 maybe a while it wrong IRA so the package yeah so we we can't get the perfect I see I so we various ultimate minimization I mean I understand some of these elements that you want to bring into the problem and they are potentially meaningful and potentially good things to bring into the problem but but currently you're not introducing them into the problem very successfully I mean they are I mean I guessed you're trying to bring in this packet link by having it to the delay constraint well that's really a different that's a different notion of delay than what was used in the previous paper and so that expression doesn't really work and then but but the second so I'm sorry what was the other issue you were wanting to bring in you want to bring in packet lengths and the fact that in tax delay how do you make yeah okay well maybe that's partly isn't it okay I think that maybe they did this problem is big maybe we're just too late okay I mean maybe I can cut have some some construction I just - I want to catch the minute the power doesn't do much see Justin I want the last forever we work fast too but I thought that the issue you were interested in was the channel State Information Oh when I thought the issue of interest to use channel State Information I mean what we were trying to do I thought is write down an optimization problem that we would want to solve if we have perfect instantaneous channel State Information yeah yeah and now it seems like you're trying to write down a different optimization problem than what has been studied before that somehow incorporates delay or delay is a function of the packet length so I think I mean I mean it's I guess I'm I'm having a little bit of trouble keeping up with what with what objective it is that you're chasing after and and you're not really when you are trying to do the mathematical formalism you're not really formalizing those ideas correctly I'm not telling you to follow one particular problem but I'm saying that I'm saying multiple things first of all I am getting multiple different messages about what your intended objective is here second of all your equations are not really matching up with what you're telling me that the objective is and you know third of all your explanation of the equations is not very clear yeah I need to meet the buffer colonel for a minute I think I think that I'm not going to be available next Monday or the Monday after that so in fact after this week I think the next day I'm going to be in the office is all January the 6th so my suggestion to you is to do some reading enjoy the holiday and we'll talk again the year one who do one o'clock I think on January the 6th 6 6 Monday January 6 okay okay one o'clock Monday January 6th okay I and our I mean you can too but I want to think a little bit about if there's a way to approach this in a different direction I don't know exactly what it is but I want to think maybe a little bit about getting back to some of the new radio if USRP stuff all right yeah all right all right
