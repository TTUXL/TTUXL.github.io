[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I do probably need to wrap things up by one I'm going to tell you so I don't forget as regards next semester well I guess you are got that email but my original hope was that by the end of the semester I would even be prepared to bring you to a full-time GRA well I hope by that in the semester I be in a position to bring you to full-time GRA but after I think leave things the way they are for next semester I I know that you're working very hard but I feel like progress has been slow difficult so I mean yeah I want to give it another semester and see how it goes [Music] yeah hi hi - yeah [Music] I mean I know but I don't think that there's an additional spot or a GTA unless you have more expertise in computer engineering yeah I know the more people want okay I don't know some summer [Music] ta [Music] I mean I'm not I'm not in the position to make a commitment about somewhere right now if there is there any possibility that your wife is picked up by Caesar in the summer I mean that's something she should talk to dr. Ron Wow [Music] [Music] [Music] maybe he'll know this when he says I don't know because I mean if she talked to dr. Radler about the possibility of a research assistantship in the summer my research [Music] I know but he works with the Center for energy systems research and they fund some students so he he has to support her doing a research assistantship for summer but but if he if he wants to he can ask dr. Moffat on that she could be supported [Music] no problem I know I am [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah I have four years of tooth problem i near holidays things [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I don't dig now is the last time that I take my website I see so you know Big Lots [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean this is all fine but it's too big these not it's not it's not specific enough I mean you to formulate a problem as I mean really talking about formulate a problem as a stochastic optimization problem but performative problem is a stochastic optimization problem you have to formulate the problem and it's not actually clear to me that formulating it is is to cast it well I mean formulating the stochastic optimization problem only partially solves the problem of not having perfect channel State Information I mean you still have to model the inverter channel State Information of the distribution so it's not clear that that improves things okay you're talking about is this a second problem yeah and is it about a paper an optimization method proposed in this paper interpreted of me my my which paper No [Music] I mean meteor theory we can if the man maker will and so the problem with both of these is the same is what we've been talking about forever they're all about a technique when you have a saw [Music] you have to pose the problem first yeah yeah the problem I mean is the front the last one a big part and they decided the population more population so I think maybe we can use the use like these to park the night work magnet car tonight so [Music] the the unit idea from me [Music] the network is worried me and every point parent company is more yes so we can if we complete all the other other notes not so more more calculation so we can use like a mini prevail and [Music] so you need to be very careful with some of this long side propagation characteristics now we don't know that that's not really true especially in indoor models there's lots of non life side propagation [Music] [Music] however as most of our to this picture I thought that's cool you see we with her he has me angry the transform yeah so what are you proposing to do with the way to transform because I want the simple Network you because really later like like a PC has more vision [Music] [Music] this is a terrible thing yeah I know I'm an author it's a terrible Oh the paper I [Music] haha I don't I don't know I'm not sure that I think that you need to define the problem more clearly before we start to talk about the solution you like both of these jumps a little bit the solution now this is a solution technique that I'm very familiar with it's basically stochastic optimization that's not really any of these other things it's just but it's not clear stochastic optimization doesn't solve the channel State Information problem in fact you could argue that it makes modeling the problem more difficult PETA Orwell [Music] [Music] most people fall days so so two things one is more people I want you to do more of what but testing used for the people and [Music] I can see people use the memo if you see the memo on the memo but you do you search new DN [Music] [Music] I'm not sure exactly what just suggests here I mean I don't [Music] [Music] you need to be very careful about writing things like this if I don't really think they're true alternans networks becomes the preferred access network promote waves are land where who says o5g says that ultra dense networks are going to become a preferred access network for mobile users become active classic network resource allocation techniques aren't sufficient to study resource optimization is that true there are additional challenges caused by alternates networks by the number of modes of the density and so on and so forth but this I mean you can't study them aren't sufficient to study resource optimization [Music] okay I think your okay [Music] we talked about this paper you know yeah not looking to have a 600 yeah Oh but I see this it's just a survey why is it decided like that with this in recent years some researchers have proposed effective solution so I I mean this is I mean [Music] other you wants to proceed what do you want to do next no no this is okay yeah but I mean it's not that there's not a direction here there is some direction here and that direction may be profitable to pursue but but I've been I've been trying to get us to figure out what the problem is that we're going to study and I guess we've gotten as far as resource allocation and ultra dense networks but resource allocation and ultra dense networks is still a very big problem yeah for which we're not going to present that one solution yes yes I know this is I I mean I'm probably cause the fuck you yeah for you what's the point like paper or report so I really I mean point I mean we've done that with the papers that we've looked at and we can look at more if that's useful but I don't understand the point here I mean the idea with this is early for Reapers maybe maybe [Applause] I want to be with these people and worry clearly and which references yeah well I I mean I can read this numeric work already and we use the myself [Music] [Music] that's network classical people [Music] this paper Plus which paper the new theory - total right on the white oh yeah so your idea is that there's something in this paper that you can combine with some of the ideas in that paper I mix this nice to talk to you [Music] so I didn't need all the on the channel [Music] so your idea is that the other paper requires perfect channel State Information yeah and you want to substitute this notion there I all right work on this tell me more about it next week I'll try to make make make the solution this problem you want to do what it's looking like this problem that's perfect to use the this part I'm I used to be like this [Music] okay how do you want to do that because you know that what I'm saying is potentially all of that is reasonable but you you do not have made a strong case for it yet so right up tell me what it is you're gonna do and what its gonna mean Hey [Music] one o'clock next one day okay good immediately next Monday night Sunday night one o'clock okay yeah we'll keep 1aqaq for actually the following week the following week we will leave it every time but one part next month but I mean I know I need a lot more detail what you're trying to do and how you're trying to do it okay okay because I I have the whole car my car maker all through and maybe I can ask I don't know how to I don't know how to because you know the first thing I study very heartily but I didn't know how to [Music] yeah I mean I understand to some extent but but I mean our goal is to [Music] [Music] you need us the red wine problem but as in the problem if I write down maybe just one sentence I can gather this master mr. tree and [Music] this okay what do you mean is I found that this this massive master tree I can do the part of the this tree and but the question you one paper and I mean you keep this matter media exactly like absolutely very is a tree I we have the best a new one maybe three right okay I mean but we're not trying to do what somebody else did what I want you to do for next week is to I mean you've mentioned combining pieces of three papers but I want you to describe as clearly and in as much detail as you can what the what the problem is what the motivation is for approaching it in this way and how you're going to go about it what the next steps are okay okay but but I mean you've read these three papers I haven't read them yeah what's what's the problem that you're trying to solve and why is it important and then what are the and then inside of the problem but but I want you to give me as much detail as you can give me you mean the detail is method like it is sure but even the problem statement yeah I mean this is this is all extremely it's it's not specific they do something I see okay okay yeah I have I have to go prepare so you made some progress all right [Music] [Music] [Music]
