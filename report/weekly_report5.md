### An Overview of UDN
**A. Definitions of UDN**

Ultra-Dense Networks can be defined as those networks where there are more cells than active users [7], [11]–[14]. In other words, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\lambda _b} \gg {\lambda _u}), where ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_b) is the density of access points, and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_u) is the density of users.  

Another definition of UDN was solely given in terms of the cell density, irrespective of the users density. Ding et al. [15] provided a quantitative measure of the density at which a network can be considered ultra-dense (≥ 103 cells/km2).

**B. Features of UDN**
1. A small coverage area, many small cells would be in a very close distance to the users.
2. Due to the high density of small cells, many small cells would be inactive.
3. Close proximity of the small cells to each other in UDN environments generates high interference.
4. Innovative frequency reuse techniques are required.
5. The backhaul of a small cell might be the bottleneck of its capacity, where the backhaul capacity would limit the air-interface capacity.
6. High probability of Line-of-Sight (LOS) transmissions.

**C. Modeling Techniques**
1. Game Theory
2. Stochastic Geometry
3. Mean-Field Games

**D. Performance Metrics**
1. **Success Probability and Outage Probability:** The probability that the SINR of a randomly selected user is above a certain threshold. In other words, the link quality is good enough to proceed to a successful connection.

2. **Rate Coverage and Rate Outage:** *Rate Coverage:* The probability that the achievable rate of an arbitrary user is above a certain minimum； *Rate Outage:* the probability that the achievable rate of an arbitrary user falls below a certain threshold.

3. **Average Spectral Efficiency:** The average number of transmitted bits per second per unit bandwidth represents the efficiency of the spectrum.

4. **Area Spectral Efficiency: Densification:** The average achievable data rate per unit bandwidth per unit area.

5. **Network Throughput:** The average number of successfully transmitted bits per sec. per Hz. per unit area.

6. **Energy Efficiency:** The ratio of the network through- put or the ASE to the power consumption per unit area.

7. **Fairness:** The fairness index measures how likely a given resource allocation scheme is fair.
