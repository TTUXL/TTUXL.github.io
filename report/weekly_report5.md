#### An Overview of UDN
**A. Definitions of UDN**

Ultra-Dense Networks can be defined as those networks where there are more cells than active users [7], [11]–[14]. In other words, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\lambda _b} \gg {\lambda _u}), where ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_b) is the density of access points, and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_u) is the density of users.  
Another definition of UDN was solely given in terms of the cell density, irrespective of the users density. Ding et al. [15] provided a quantitative measure of the density at which a network can be considered ultra-dense (≥ 103 cells/km2).

**B. Features of UDN**
1. A small coverage area, many small cells would be in a very close distance to the users.
2. Due to the high density of small cells, many small cells would be inactive.
3. Close proximity of the small cells to each other in UDN environments generates high interference.
4. Innovative frequency reuse techniques are required.
5. The backhaul of a small cell might be the bottleneck of its capacity, where the backhaul capacity would limit the air-interface capacity.
6. High probability of Line-of-Sight (LOS) transmissions.
