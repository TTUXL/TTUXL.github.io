what decisions to two points and one answer my question I push this what decision is being made first sometimes in order to obtain the best energy efficiency what are you going to change to improve energy efficiency we can use this kind posture to convey the emergency is this almost a seat what decision is being made to make the network more efficient is it power control is it choosing channels is it choosing resource blocks as it choosing user Association what decision would be I need energy efficiency as a result of decisions that are made what's the control variables controlled I mean the control the ice of poll vegetation power yeah yeah is that all and today station power control yeah yeah okay but where can I find a mathematical expression of this problem they station power control if we use the in fair theory I may need a catheter the mall the channel channel station information so if the but write it down show me what the problem is the problem the problem you just told me is power clean service base station power control yeah and that's okay there's some possibility that that problem is too narrow I think there's actually a high possibility that that problem is too narrow but base station power control okay this is a problem that can deal with I truly is Trish not back she told me she was coming back as soon as she could okay I assume it's a steady stream of people wanting to get things didn't really affect alright so yeah you can close it so the problem is power control yeah so you should be able to write down for me what the power control problem is that is what happenes if the if the goal is energy efficiency isn't just to minimize the total power but yeah okay if the goal is to minimize the total power it's got to be minimize the total power but in accordance with some constraints I mean the mean person read the pizza very good but he completions so so so we use to power easy to control okay but ultimately I mean I'll tell you I am skeptical as to whether or not mean field theory is a good tool here now cause mean field theory assumes that you can take all of these interferes out there and treat them as one kind of you look at the actions of one player and then you kind of treat all the other actions in the network is it collectively yeah and that it's not clear to me that works here because just my long story short you have to compare it to something anyway so you should be able to you put-put mean field theory away for a minute can you write down the problem you said Space Station power control so I've got a set of base stations let's assume that their locations are given to me and so my control variable here is the power level for each base station so if the goal is energy efficiency then let's say the objective is to minimize the sum of powers given in base stations set up base stations base stations 1 2 up to anything with locations there was notation we use for that lig for all I and B our goal is minimize some of P I such that some constraints are satisfied where P I is transmit power base station I yeah but you're gonna run all this constraints that's the hard part what's up we need we need Chekov sir Travel Channel station information to tell state information so we can use the estimation I'm a me I'm off get it why is that a constraint why do I care about that is a constant that's not a constraint on the supplementation broth soup assume for a moment that all channel information is available perfectly what is the optimization problem if all channel State Information is known what is this optimization problem all the information we need singing singing overhead ignore overhead no no overhead this is this is part of the problem that we're having the communication is that you're assuming that I know what problem we are under trying to solve here what underlying problem we're trying to solve and you're never telling me what that problem is so I mean okay mean so starting place and you just told me that there's work out there that does this already which I believe but the starting what is what the question is what that work trying to accomplish what optimization problem is that work trying to to solve yeah I know I know you know York and the problem is clearly I always keep you slow the last flower give me what give me the solution slow you give me solutions what you don't tell me what the problem is yeah but were you tell me some like you are right now the problem is that's very expensive to pass around the channel State Information which is true and you also might say I think you've said this before I don't know if you're saying right now but by the time you can collect all the channel state information in one place it's it's too old anyway because channel same channel state changes very quickly so there's also a latency problem in addition to a problem with the resources that would be required to bring the channel State Information to one place but I mean the conventional way to do work in this area is to say okay suppose we know everything a genie gives us perfect channel State Information okay then what optimization problem are we trying to solve yeah and so you'll find in the literature our solutions to such a problem if we had perfect channel State Information then here's what we would want to do and here would be the resulting energy efficiency of the network yeah and then then you can say but we do not live in a perfect world that we do not have perfect channel State Information so what are we going to do in that more realistic world but but but we both have to be clear about what is the solution we would want if we had perfect channel state information communicated instantaneously and unlimited computational capability to solve an optimization problem if we had all those things what optimization problem is it that we would be trying to solve and the reason and part of the reason we want that is we need to assess how good our solution is when we don't have to do a perfect channel State Information can it come close to what we would do if we had perfect channel State Information or is there a gap if there's a gap how big is the gap and can we reasonably explain how big the gap is on the basis of how much it would cost us to move around which channel State Information so we're going to do something suboptimal because something not optimal because we don't have perfect channel State Information that's how I show you is about people - the imperfect yeah yeah so I just follow this way how to get it if before every complicated appropriate information and I know if you but you want the channel channel State Information change very fast and so you you you you you if you use the together all this information to completion to command commands the everything so we will be missing maybe we can used like to run for the nearest world human human children it's a human rights all the problem of access to information no no but I just this thing like this people reside all the P eyes are like like agent like the same agent so everyone wants to kinda there is meanness all agents to gain so we return use this idea for the long term long term revolve the shortened to appreciation organization my energy optimize with respect to what we had use we had the pro ivory TI's all US considerably for work got to low efficiency in inter inference it's kind of old needles okay so now you're talking about interference yeah an interference shows up somewhere in those constraints there even if you have perfect tail state information this said yeah could this is why don't use the distribution distribution this is why I keep asking you what's the problem that we're trying to solve and you're talking to me about the problem of not having channel State Information which is an important problem a very important problem in many of these problems but I have to know first what problem is it that we solve if we do have perfect channel State Information I mean there's at least three problems with perfect channel State Information right and one is it takes an enormous amount of the system resources to it takes an enormous amount of communication resources in the system to collect those channel that channel state information in one place I mean I'm the networking guy I talk about networking over mattad and all of that is networking overhead yeah and if you're using 90% of your network resources to move channel State Information around then you're only 10% of your network right this is number one number two is latency you by the time you collect all that channel state information together in one place even if the network resources are free the channel State Information by that point is old yeah and so it's no good anymore and they have number three problem with the channel State Information is is that even when I can collect all the channel State Information together against athenaeus lis if I do it for a large enough Network it's going to be computationally intractable I'm not going to be able to do the computing on it once I have it all but before we solve these three problems with channel State Information all of which can often be dealt with independently I might add there's different problems and there's different solutions to each of these three problems even though they're all related to channel State Information but before I can do that I'd like to know what would I do if I had perfect instantaneous channel state information for free and unlimited computational resources so if I could collect together all of the channel State Information at a centralized location with a supercomputer even when better than any Linux system earth right now what problem would I be trying to solve I can't write that problem down then how can you tell me how good a solution is that helps me deal with imperfect channel State Information [Music] you mean it really say we have the perfect formation and the point is there's not one such problem there are many possible ways to complete that problem okay I know what is the problem yeah I perfect the information but we think the tour it many can use maybe if you know the area maybe some subway station no user maybe some station ever missed base station have more user so like this picture and I'm any maybe no user maybe maybe maybe maybe run the protists are fast we can't dancing for two part one part is you're trying to describe to me a resource allocation problem which is how do we do power can have a new base station power control I'm asking the primary question which is what's the objective of our base station power control and okay you tell me the objective is power efficiency well maybe nothing minimizes some of the power but you have to tell me what the constraints are well that's not a well-formed problem presumably the constraints are related to coverage and capacity of this area but there's lots of different ways to pose those coverage and capacity requirements and they're going to change what I would do if I had perfect channel State Information sorry I don't know you walked at the perfect information you give us what I'm trying to ask it if we assume the existence of perfect channel State Information then how do you want to do powerful I have seen the policy and you don't even have to tell me what the algorithm is you just have to tell me what the optimization problem is that we would like to solve I don't know you just went along to this function and the constraint you've started to describe here is not really a constraint that belongs on here I don't even I'm probably from doing a power control problem like you constraint you've written here her is about how bad the channel State Information is and the fact of the matter is I don't really care how about the channel State Information is I care how good the solution is you can provide me with a great power control solution that requires zero channel State Information than that would be fantastic right maybe okay yeah but I really I really want that error I don't how deep the error is in the channel State Information is not important to me as a primary concern but but but I'm actually saying right now ignore channel State Information for a moment we're going to bring it back in a little bit but we have to understand what the problem is that we're trying to solve first what would I do with perfect channel State Information or you can answer the question of what he would do with imperfect Channel station but because that last time for the last time I actually the problem is Union Union so many conclusion so many over have okay that but if you're going to say that's the problem then you have to write down a resource allocation problem that takes that into account if you're going to say the problem is too many handovers the units are write down your resource allocation problem you have to write down an optimization problem that says that reduces the demand shadows yeah I'll wait both in my paper ball always okay okay maybe active choose not power control maybe it doesn't matter to me at the moment what the resource allocation probably pick but we have to know what problem we're talking about before we can talk about solution technically so you're talking about solution techniques that are possib it or partially but you're partially arguing about these three things I just told you you're partially telling me it makes the computation ease a little easier you're partially telling me it means I don't have to pass the channel State Information around which deals with both of these problems but-but-but-but you stopped to tell me what it is I'm trying to solve yeah I know i yeah because if I can't think about the self I don't know how to write these things because I think both we become panelists so right the Pope of Roman holy this idea so what maybe but it's a way that we usually wind up solving a problem that I don't care about okay okay I know I think we don't know you that's the because there's an old expression then I may have shared with you before I've certainly shared with many other students before you and that is if the only tools that you have as a hammer then every problem looks like a nail so what I'm saying is we have to know what problem we're talking about but before we can talk about what tools to use to solve it and there is some there is some iteration here which is the first version of the problem that we write down once we work with some tool we may decide this is not exactly the right version of the problem and we need to change some constraints or we need to change the objective function or something like this and that's okay so there's some iteration here but you can talk about the tool until you know what problem it is yeah and I'm just getting getting not very specific problem descriptions yeah I know the only I mean I pushed you I pushed you and pushed you to twist you and finally you told me the problem was base station power control okay I have to work with that but what's the objective Wow okay the objective is energy efficiency okay but then okay what are the constraints if the objective is energy efficiency I set all the powers to zero right this is the most energy efficient solution just turn all the best stations off right yeah yeah no I'm joking right this would have zero power usage but it also yielded not functioning Network right that's what I'm saying yeah if your problem is here you have no constraints then you just set VI to 0 set all P eyes to 0 so why don't you do that well you don't do that because then you don't have a functional Network so there's some requirements to get a functional Network it may be that you're next yeah I know so let's so you'll wind up writing down some constraints here that have to do with coverage and capacity I mean the next possibility is that you turn to all the base stations off except for one and you're probably going to pick the one that's in the middle of your area you're right I mean these are these deep and this problem is not a new problem it's not really a problem it's not really even an ultra dense network problem I mean there's some work on topology control on wireless networks going back decades and but if we don't know what if we don't know what we're trying to accomplish with our resource allocation then looking at how we do it without adequate channel State Information he doesn't make too much sense because we don't know what it is we're trying to get so so you don't that doesn't even have to be one the answer to this question but there has to be at least my answer to this question which is what are the things that we look at when we do base stations one of the things that we look at when we do base station power outpatient there are some expressions we can write down yeah expressions related to coverage and capacity for users in some area of concern so yeah we need to go farther without I need to know more I need to know more about what problem would be solved if we have perfect information so that when we solve the problem with imperfect information we can know if we got a good solution okay okay okay now or you can do Monday but let's make it to okay all right okay all right thank you thank you yeah okay I mean I mean research is that all other things that differently thank you
