I mean there are interesting elements of wrong So, I'm sure I mean there are reasons to think about multiple Access, you know Melanie the way Network the don't have anything to do the college computer And I think it would be easier to motivate the problem without I mean, it's just all I mean the whole look the set up is still on the one hand Incomplete. Yeah, you're not getting a whole. You know, you haven't given a whole system model here You have really given a whole problem formulation here. There's not But on the other hand you drill down into things that are laid out on the leaves I mean This parents different a messy research would Do that this model particle camp Different appeal. Yes in the different If if the the two-way is here And all this is not least or this stupid no, no no look I do this research Yeah, that's true I don't I mean, that's not if this is your research problem Yeah, yeah this dust It's very little to do with the problem that you claim you want to study And I mean, I don't think this has much to do with it either Well, we hear about my writing code to look at a model that I don't know that we even have a good reason to believe that I mean what I've seen from channel modeling on millimeter-wave suggests that this blockage modeling is not Going to give you very realistic expectations of what the channel performance is like So you're taking the blocking model that we don't necessarily believe it Sensitive our results they wanted to be to water quality chose I mean, yes, it's true Your base stations are in the same direction. There will be correlation between channels. Yeah But Nobody knows exactly what that correlation looks like I'm not sure that I believe that the plot was this blocky father was going to tell us answer I'm struggling with how to suggest that you proceed with all this Like I said, there's a real problem There's some reasonable problems that our look at personal attribute that off pronounce but Because I don't think the problem The edge computing pieces of this is You can consider a related problem that it's not the fundamental problem here is do you try to do multi? Connectivity is over your wife at work Yeah, what are you doing mobilizing on the backside of that Oh they did this Maybe we have This world But I see the other people's dust the Odyssey mission Accident ever almost by the work Bottling yes We may be Tested tested the past So we know this word work easy to Overly of Locate location Like decoding the cooking we need more All mass we can Before Just get some big data So you even when they offer me with? Actually the hole They did need two more transformation The general we use the results If We Are holding their noses Maybe maybe Is the more tangled result What I'm telling you though Subban is that there's two different problems here There's one else to do your single connectivity your multi connectivity And I think that's an interesting problem in middle ear a venture In fact be our new single connector near multiple connectivity If you do multiple connectivity then how do you choose the subset of base stations or connect to what kind of multi? You should kind of talk here about sending some bits here and some that's there. I don't think that's what That's not what? Else. Do you want to do a coding scheme where you either want to do a simple scheme? Where you where you do repetition? Or you want to do a coding scheme, where you go? Where you don't have to receive the bits and every basic there are multiple options for are you multi connectivity? But anyway multi connectivity Versus single connectivity there are lots of interesting properties that are in the middle your web space There are also quite a few minutes of speed problems in both legend beauty. I Don't think there's any reason right now to make these a joint problem I mean the the e I'm using an EC is a lot about autism What's the point I mean if you're away Multi-access can save the power, but you can do that without Multi access potentially save some power for the communication doesn't anything to do with the computing You're combining two concepts and they're both valid concepts and may be out there somewhere There's a reason to combine them. You haven't told me what it is yet There's interesting problems potentially with both of them but You pose that you're trying to pose a joint problem here and it's not clear that there's a compelling reason right now to consider this problem jointly You believe this problem is so hard maybe But whether it's hard or not Whether it's hard or not multi connectivity part of interesting problems Mobile edge computing is a hard and interesting problem If you're going to try to combine them you need a compelling reason to do so otherwise, it looks to me like the goal in it makes sense to Come up with your best solution for multi connectivity come up with your best solution for mobile edge community And put them together. Don't try to come up with the solution to the same time Our policy is I want Not a small delay right other thing is that This way if you want to know This me you see This way, is that how? Simp better package is This more delay They come Correct the problem why connected Because memories will have Easy to draw rock. So we so you need multi connectivity. That's not anything to do with mobile edge computing Because the pocket is higher multi connectivity mix that's period full stop Stop okay at a company Asked I mean I'm asking you a question here, but you're not answering. You know, I mean, unfortunately, this is a pattern I mean I can't I just can't I mean we've been trying for months now to find a research problem and And okay multi connectivity is a good research problem But but But that's what I'm saying multi connectivity is a good research problem, but you don't need mobile edge computing to talk about it And in fact if you can't even hear not necessarily four-millimeter way But if you came in here and said you wanted to talk about mobile edge computing and that there is probably some resource allocation Interesting question there as to whether or not you should all load a task or not That might have something to do with the communications environment that you're in then I could agree with that too But but I can't see at this moment Unless unless the literature is far more advanced than I think it is. I don't think it's true. I Can't see at the moment. Why? We should try to consider these two problems together both potentially very hard problems Yeah, I know why the hell researcher to to gather this power It has the money That's okay The only the only way forward I can think of is this is I think that you should proceed with continuing to look at multiple access Multi connectivity in little meteorite networks. I Think you should construct a problem statement that deals with multi activities Specifically, how do you suppose I that how many and which big stations you should try to connect to and then think it well Frankly, you need to go back to the literature on this because it has been looked at some I don't think that the solute there's not a solution in the literature that solves all the problems in my opinion and Suck and in fact, in fact, you need to broaden your literature search a little bit because there's work on multi connectivity That's not just millimeter wave related There's some work on multi connectivity and cellular systems that goes beyond multi connectivity I'm sorry, because beyond millimeter wave so multi connectivity in cellular systems Some of that gets into And that's part of the problem is there's multiple approaches to what you mean by that - you can be sending some data - You can make one transmission and the multiple base stations that you select can act as a distributed antenna To do detection and reception of those bits That's one extreme At the other four extreme I send different bits to each base station and then in between there are other things like I Send different bits to each base station, but then there's a coding scheme where somewhere in the wired Network. We combine these We do decoding on the combiner packets. And so there are lost packets we can recover there are There are Yeah, there are simpler schemes out there where we Don't do multiple where we don't try to do multiple detection from these different base stations treating them as different antennas, but we Choose the base station that received the packet the best and that's the whole news. I Mean, that's a pretty simple scheme, right? You have three base stations who are assigned to receive this transmission. They all receive a version of it. They Compare and say who for this packet perception had the highest signals interference invoice ratio and we're gonna reliable they receive or who can who can Decode the packet and get the checksum, right? We'll take what they say or we have a primary Base station that's receiving the packet It's the pocket in the checksum works when we keep that And if not, then we try to see if any of the other base stations got there are so many different ways to do Multi connectivity And some of them are specific to millimeter wave and some of them were not I Do think that looking at that four millimeter wave specifically is a good thing to do But you need further background on what's already in the literature on this So two things to do not necessarily disorder one is to start a literature search on a multipack table Your work and the other is to try to come up the recasting of this problem I don't think you're there yet But try to come up with a recasting of this problem is about multi connectivity and let's leave the bubble in computing aside. I Mean you still have some of the same concerns right you if you're transmitting data, you may still have to lay constraints Now delay constraints is probably going to lead you to a different multiple connectivity solution than maximizing their liabilities or maximizing data rate and I don't know that I don't know the minimizing delay is necessarily the right thing to do, but it's one option All right I have a thought we've got an email. I don't answer Yeah Okay, okay Remind me who Is seeking this information that's been one. Yes, I mean tell her Center what you know Center the other information Okay, just I have sent Me yeah I have Okay, okay, yeah Okay, all right, thank you Yeah, well almost 100 houses yeah Taman their solos Is your for four whole different or me anyo Do it, what are you doing the Iowa doll wait you had no real Adam a4 paper Total phony on sugar hold on. Yeah ten Aloha. Do you know my mom?
