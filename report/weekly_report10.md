The author considers  the impact of the following factors on ultradense networks (UDNs)  
1. closed-access operations and line-ofsight conditions   
2. the near-field effect  
3. the antenna height difference between small cell BSs and user equipments (UEs)  
4. the surplus of idle-mode-enabled small cell BSs with respect to UEs.  
It is concluded that  the existence of an optimum BS density to maximise the area spectral efficiency (ASE) for a given finite UE density.

The author studies the asymptotic properties of average area spectral efficiency (ASE) of a downlink cellular network in the limit of very dense base station (BS) and user densities. When there is no constraint on the minimum operational signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and instantaneous full channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, the average ASE is proven to saturate to a constant.
