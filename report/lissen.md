is this the same paper we've been looking at

okay tell me what there is to know

prediction ,so I mean I don't really like them

I mean I saw this when are you writing I was kind of waiting to see what you said about it

 but I don't really like the way that you're framing this

  I mean you say the optimization problem is the work of the base station is initialized

  I mean that's not really true at all there may be a little bit of optimization on base station initialization

  but there's constantly resource allocation problems to solve and constantly problems that can be set up as optimization problems

  because even after the base station is initialized the set of users is constantly changing the user demands are constantly changing

   I mean right now my phone is in my pocket ，I could pull it out and I could surf the web or check my email or make a phone call or make a video call and I mean that's changing the demands on the network and that's going to change the appropriate resource allocation right and so there are a couple you are sort of alluding to this here a little bit ，but there are a couple of different ways you can handle that one is you can resolve the optimization problem over and over again

   you can say okay one of the users right now in this cell and what are their demands and so how am I going to allocate resources and you essentially can set up an optimization problem and solve it right or you can do something with more of an online flavor which is which is to say okay  I have this resource allocation and now there's a new demand or a new user appears and so now I'm going to now I'm going to change my allocation but not resolve the optimization problem

    I'm going to let's say I have some extra resources

    I'm going to assign those resources to the new user well now a user finishes their task and somehow some resources become free and those are available for another user there are other approaches to this kind of online optimization as well

    you also talked some about predicting the users movement

     I guess I would say a couple of things one is that user movement is two things one is user movement is not the only or even I would say the primary source of uncertainty in these networks

     it's any source of uncertainty

     but it's not the only one okay

     I mean and the other is even once you know the use of movement you still don't know the channel

      because there's channel uncertainty even if you know the users precise location and lots of people especially in networking talk about knowing the users location as if that's the primary thing

and I think that's a mistake because I think that most of the time resolving the users location doesn't really resolve the channel uncertainty does that make sense

so I guess all I'm saying is I mean there are lots of ideas here that you have mentioned and some of them are probably reasonably good approaches depending on the problem

but I don't know exactly what you mean by the transfer model using distance way of principal component analysis may be corresponding what is msg yep what is the math gene uh in theory okay yeah okay let's but but I still want to try to get you

okay so I'm still talking a little bit about this first thing

I mean it is absolutely true that computational complexity and resource allocation is one of the primary problems associated with or one of the primary problems and alter those networks

but the solution is not in my opinion ，in my opinion the solution is not going to be one size fits all it's going to depend on how you choose to frame the resource allocation problem ，

I mean I mean which you're still not being quite specific about in terms of the problem that we're going to solve you if we look here I'm not going to look down here yet but if we look here you you're talking about resource allocation and ultra dense networks yeah yeah that's still not one problem yeah that's a dozen problems are more there is this user Association there's channel assignments there's there's there's how you're going to manage spectrum and channels in this ultra dense network there is

there's rate allocation and so kind of modulation and coding selection how you're going to do adaptive modulation and coding what I'm saying is resource allocation is not one thing there are many different resources and a wireless network yeah and so it's not so so

if we want to talk about solution I think we should first be more specific about which resource allocation problem we're talking about

I have maybe five four five or six open issue but I choose this one okay

what I'm saying is so when they say five or six open issues they're talking really about five or six categories of open issues they've taken to all of the open issues and they tried to categorize them so that they can talk about them sensibly and so what I'm saying is within each of these there's more than one problem

this is a class of problems， and it's an interesting class of problems and it's a class of problems that I have a lot of interested but but it's uh but but I want you to be more specific to still [Music] don't don't misunderstand me this is the this is this is as close as we've gotten what to say we're okay by the truth

I just want to like this oh yeah oh yeah that's it yeah and the second problem

you've mentioned here significant overhead and feedback I mean this is a closely related this is closely related to the first problem because so we're talking about optimization probably the first problem we're talking about optimization problems

but the problem is to even close the problem with an optimization problem a lot of times you have to collect all this information about what's happening in the network and often the computational or the communication overhead required to collect all the information is too costly ok so by the time so it's not worth it this what I'm saying you could make them you can make a worse decision but with less information and have it be better [Music] so let's say what we're talking about here is a resource allocation problem that also prevents networks and that's a very complex problem yeah and it's a come it's a computationally complex problem okay yeah but [Music] okay

in order to write down the problem so talk about an optimization problem writing clearly my career design my question clearly clearly divine my table clearly did price my problem what I mean I need clearly or clearly my talk right on yeah I'm talking about I mean yes we're narrowing down and I think this is a good I think this is let's not separate these into a and B because I think a good problem here combines aspects of both a and B okay yeah but I'm trying to so so yes what I said a minute ago is yeah a is good but it's still too broad okay we need to talk about a problem more narrowly before we start talking about solutions okay okay but but what I'm trying to say to you now is B is actually very closely related to a mm yeah because a is a pool week

and maybe this is a new idea I can find the solution that is [Music] that user use them I'm not sure you're following what I'm saying about B I'm trying to explain from my point of view the relationship between VNA so what Amy says is it says that the resource allocation problem in these networks is is is computationally complex right and that's really it's about an optimization problem right yeah so what makes it computationally complex is that there are many variables and there are many possibilities for each variable so I have all of these users of all of these it's ultra dense network so I have lots of users I have lots of base stations in a small space there's lots of interference between them there's lots of channel assignment decisions to be made they have to allocate the users to base stations it's a it's a very complex optimization problem yeah yeah hey number one the optimization problem itself is complex it's complex to write down and it's complex to solve and that's what we mean by computational complexity here right is that essentially often the often the the size of the problem is going up exponentially with the number of let's say base stations that we put into space okay but B is closely related but problem B says the problem is not just computational complexity which is what a is about the problem is you can't even set up the problem because you don't have enough information centralized remember I've said you had to write down a complicated problem in a in order to write down this problem you have to know the channels between every user and every base station yeah in order to know the channel between every user in every base station you have to measure the channel between every user in everyday station and then you have to communicate all of this information back to a central location in order to solve optimization in order to write down the optimization problem so that you can solve it yeah hi hi oh yeah yeah and no one does this and the reason no one does this is because it's not worth it the communication to collect all this information is more expensive than the than the marginal benefit you get from solving an optimization problem so people do different things instead they may choose to solve a distributed version of the problem even though they will not get as good of results they may choose to solve a greatly simplified version of the problem so instead of giving you all the channel coefficients I give you a few bits what I'm saying is there's very high interaction between a and B here yeah and that's really part of the optimization here it's not just how do you solve the optimization problem in a [Music] but how you suck the right optimization problem given that here's a way to put it I can make the optimization problem in a as accurate as I want yeah but it's not free the more accurate you make the problem the more expensive it is to set it up and it's expensive in terms of overhead it's expensive in terms of how many bits you have to pass around the network just to set up the optimization problem and there's a trade-off there because at some point it's not worth it at some point you would be better off making random decisions right I meant random decisions and they're not they're not good decisions yeah but they have no overhead yeah so you guys so what you have is you have this extreme you can do zero communication everyone just chooses or something randomly but then you're gonna have you're gonna have interference you're gonna have channel conflicts you're gonna have difficulty in assigning the user to the right base station and so on and so forth that's one extreme that they follow other extreme is you try to centralize all the information about the network so that you can make perfect centralized decisions and then communicate them background [Music] no one operates at either extreme so there's a there's an optimization problem associated with finding the right amount of information to exchange in order to make good decisions so this is why I think metric to complete completion that's interesting and I am sure that there are some [Music] but just but we need to be talking about a specific problem yeah that's right yeah and I have the matrix completion algorithm okay I can believe that that has something to offer here but the but the but I'm not sure that I see a recommendation system as being the right analogy here I mean detective this is about me I hear no does the Sui sings see the silly part [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] okay okay my sweetheart super this yeah [Music] [Music] okay this idea from yo-yo school students and 50s and be excited before Monday please paper beside yes faithfully side the ice right P is depreciated did we talk about every time this is the ice and I find you how do any student with people for you YouTube user user user energy usually needy so I think maybe can fund a best P is number but the number of I mean I maybe I'm not understanding the idea but I think this was overly simplistic for determining ha so I don't know this may be I think the sweetie I mean you said this idea is maybe have somebody have done this not while you see this I hear is why don't optimal number of base stations in terms of what [Music] so we have built we had estimation the sea-ice number so if we choose the quantity militant roadway so I can to knowledge the this part or more are the number of the ice [Music] so if we know the number of years so we have commander this for example this is yes move Camus the ice pull here as they all can you sleep I mean before if we thought the apart earlier how number of yes meaning I mean we can know well we have no are we are how many PS is good [Music] you do not need [Music] utility okay but I mean utility what's the utility function nobody knows what the utility function is this is a problem you have your utility function I have my utility function it's not the same as horizons utility function it's not the same as a TT utility function nobody knows what and the utility function also varies it depends on what's happening right the utility function for the verizon network in for users who are attending a sporting event is different than the utility function for the verizon network when users are driving in their cars and so lots of papers will say here's the utility function but that's a number that's a function their researchers made up and often often one of the biggest problems with these works to be perfectly honest is that the utility the utility function is often indefensible or very hard to defend or or only reasonable in certain circumstances I mean this is true at every level what is a user's utility for data rate so we just start to ask that question okay most users we think have a utility function that increases with rate you're happier if I give you higher rate than it might give you a lower rate right yeah well that's true to a certain point but it's but there's also diminishing returns here right at some point you at some point you're not that much happier if I give you if you go from one megabit per second to two megabits per second then you may be significantly happier right but if you go from 11 megabits per second to 12 bits per second you may not have noticed the difference and if you go from 101 megabits per second to 102 megabits per second almost guaranteed that you won't notice the difference right so your utility is kind of saturating at some point and depend from the application if you're watching your streaming video there's some data rate below which the video is unwatchable and so then it almost doesn't matter whether I give you zero data rate or anything up to that data rate look this below that you're having a very bad experience in fact in fact there's probably a point at which you would be happier with zero data rate that it was something that gives you really lousy video because the really lousy video I was just going to make you mad it might make you matter than if you if the system just said video isn't work right okay and then then there's a period of where your utility is increasing where the video quality is acceptable but as I give you more rate you can make the video better and better but then you hit some rate where you've got full high-definition video and giving you extra rate doesn't make you happy here anymore there are other applications where the utility function is almost a step function if your rate is below this you're unhappy if your rate is above this you're happy so so I'm just talking about the utility function for a single user so now you start to talk about network utility function in fact there's this whole family network utility maximization yeah the problem is nobody knows what the network utility function is right let me stick with the user for a minute you're a user now you're using multiple applications on your laptop or phone and each application has a different utility function what's your utility now if you're downloading files and browsing the web and you have streaming video in the corner what's your utility yes yeah now you do know wireless networking it's not one user its Verizon has 20 users in this cell and has a thousand users across this region so what is their utility for their network well it's maybe some complicated function of the individual users utility and we don't even know what those are so so back to the question you were trying to ask what's the optimal number of base stations to deploy in this area your question was can we write down something that tells us for a given area what's the optimal number of base stations yeah well it depends okay it also depends very strongly on what's the technology that these users used to share resources I mean if the last bar I changed ^ okay sorry June the last term did you name it cancel I'm trying to tell you is I'm not sure this is ever going to be a well-formed problem written down this way because what the right number of base stations is depends on what the objective is and there's no agreement in the research community about what the objective is yeah I just found oh maybe maybe maybe in this I here maybe can use [Music] have some problems [Music] the the this problem maybe you can we can use this on the big bit early [Music] communication we can choose the best PS asunder power the ps4 work maybe that's the best way for everyone the power transmission line so I think maybe simple the demo is my clan fear here [Music] this is the best maybe we can use the tool but like a power up for by minor for better for our powers law this is horrible and if it will be we use the like this also the RFP station from Oslo but more repairs [Music] [Music] this area this action and Amanda there's a lip and I see this I reacted for this function [Music] have some from rock before I gave this is maybe 13% panda is 24 [Music] I do not understand what you're trying to do [Music] sorry I just I mean maybe I can make a mode for for planned transmission for transmission tractor trailer park camo camo is the new gentleman the ten model is only ten model will be used used as or or as right so but this we can find that's not really true I mean there are situations in which we might divide channels in tune online cyber - site but I mean there's all kinds of different channel models out there I just decide maybe something for for karma combined is his distribution for for wall-to-wall [Music] me miss - miss me this part show the this area I want more whoa yeah we kind of communicate the model from the people there - you missed it simple [Music] I mean simply [Music] I don't understand what problem you're trying to solve [Music] [Music] I'm in one place station control the area maybe for this function this function what's new here what's new here I mean we have channel balls yeah yeah yeah I know but but this function you can use to throw sorry baby can use the udn neutral magnetons network so we can be coming on completing is so company completely team so you need sibling [Music] that's okay yeah I just my manifesto the library I mean I think you're on the right track here in terms of thinking about [Music] if you're on the right track here in terms of thinking about resource allocation issues and ultra dense networks and the fact that they give rise to complex large-scale optimization problems and to connect this to the fact that even constructing these optimization problems requires an enormous amount of overhead and feedback and so what we need is we need when we need a lot of different things before a given resource allocation problem is ultra dense networks we need a way to make resource allocation decisions based on limited information that perform reasonably well under a variety of circumstances okay you don't need my first okay but but I need for I need I need - I need for you to formulate more specific problems resource allocation that will a and B are really about resource allocation the resource allocation is too broad tell me which resources you're allocating for what purposes in a given Network and set up install the problem will sound first the problem there [Music] [Music] [Music] maybe we had to the Allies because this people know Kara who care the otherwise miracle rail so we [Music] I don't know the macedon no we're not ready for method yet anyway yeah I sound like I like the big number other the number of to be go to the humanity [Music] defend so [Music] [Music] maybe I think this part this title recommendation is the solution for [Music] example [Music] magic cupcakes maybe maybe yeah but you have to tell me what the problem is first you haven't told me what the problem is yet um problem is you can't tell me now yeah yeah the problem is resource allocation but that's not specific enough yeah yeah [Music] the problem is the I am thinking is the the user for example the user a better source model so we need to save better and we need to control the high hat or hide and so we can use the this problem [Music] there are elements of the problem there [Music] I mean you're telling me now it's a problem energy efficiency because of user batteries okay but but there's several things that are going to affect use your battery usage I mean there's power control of course but power control is everything there's also well back to this ad thing we're talking about here how our control is one thing but if I have a perfect power control algorithm but it requires that I number one exchange an enormous number of messages with the network before I can do my kind of control algorithm well that's going to be very costly and number two if it requires that I run an extremely complex optimization problem on my phone well that's gonna cost a lot of power so these things these things are all interrelated with each other but you have to define what specifically you're going to be looking at before you can propose a solution yeah I mean weird right yeah because I think someone was waiting for me at 2:00 okay and I think about that time I I want to yeah but I want you to find some these two papers are good but I want you to find and reform yeah yeah there's a sense in which these are a little bit too broad in scope because we have to start to talk about narrow down I want you to read some examples where people have narrowed down the problem they're looking at they're looking at something more specific because because right now we're not there I mean you're making you're making progress but we're just not there yet okay didn't progress No you have made some progress okay but we're still not to the point where we can pick a tool because we don't have a specific problem yet okay okay okay that's still off Yeah right okay next time we get a little bit closer okay I mean you don't think that's time we're going to be there maybe maybe not that's time we get a little bit closer oh okay all right that's the one okay yeah yeah the hold always okay yeah [Music] interesting yeah you know you hydrate yeah but I want I mean these are still there this is still there overview of millimeter wave communications it's still a very broad paper yeah I want you to start to read not that you're gonna do the same thing that they do but I want you to start reading narrower papers I want you to start reading papers we're not gonna write a paper like this at least not soon we're going to write a conference paper that does one thing okay okay yeah I'm asking you to do a survey because I want you to see the big picture but but we're not gonna do all of this right now we're gonna do some little thing okay oh okay I'm gonna do a little more and then we do a little more and it's a journal paper and okay yeah okay
